## Some background from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health NSAPH:
Epidemiology and Environmental Health Scientists play a critical role in identifying and understanding the factors that influence population health outcomes. However, conducting such studies can be challenging, particularly when it comes to accessing individual-level data on health outcomes for large, representative populations. 
 
One of the most important providers of US-wide claims data is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS collects and maintains data on healthcare utilization, expenditures, and health outcomes for millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.  
 
CMS data is a rich and important source of information; however, its usage is hindered by complications. CMS data require substantial work to be harmonized across years and cleaned for research purposes. In addition, access to CMS data is tightly controlled and requires researchers to comply with strict data usage agreements. 
 
CMS recently started providing publicly available synthetic Medicare data. While synthetic data has limited inferential research value to draw conclusions, it can be used to develop and test tools. For the assignment, you will use the synthetic Medicare data (DE-SynPUF)  to illustrate the generation of research-grade datasets for environmental health studies.
